# DOOM on a SteelSeries Keyboard OLED
* Ultrawide? 4K? No. 128×40 monochrome glory.*

This project attempts to run DOOM (or mirror DOOM’s gameplay) on a SteelSeries keyboard’s tiny built-in OLED display.
It’s completely impractical, surprisingly charming, and absolutely essential work in the field of “Will it run DOOM?”.

# Project Goal

Use the SteelSeries keyboard’s OLED display (found on Apex Pro, Apex 7, etc.) as a miniature external monitor by capturing gameplay frames and downscaling them to the OLED’s resolution.
